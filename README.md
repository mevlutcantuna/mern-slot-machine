## SLOT MACHINE GAME

In this project,I worked mainly with MERN, but I mentioned techs which I worked in README.md's of client and server. This project includes signup,login with all validations and play game. I used MongoDB as database.When a user spend or win coins, database updates. When every user signup,they have 20 coins to play game.
